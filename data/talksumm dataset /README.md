In the TalkSumm folder, there is a folder (and its zipped version) with text files of papers' extractive summaries. 
In order to obtain the abstractive summaries of these papers, run get_pdfs.py in you command line interface. 
This will create a folder and automatically start downloading the PDFs of the full research papers from their URLs. (WARNING: MIGHT TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE)
